# What is GitHub?
* It allows users to keep track of changes made to a project — whether it’s a programming project, a design project, or both.
* It promotes the concept of divide-and-conquer through “branching,” a technique that allows learners to work on sections of a project independently.
* It encourages sharing in an open source manner, which is especially helpful in the classroom.
* It is much more than I can explain in 20 minutes.
