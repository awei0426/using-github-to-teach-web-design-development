# What is GitHub?
* It allows users to keep track of changes made to a project — whether it’s a programming project, a design project, or both.
* It promotes the concept of divide-and-conquer through “branching,” a technique that allows learners to work on sections of a project independently.
* It encourages sharing in an open source manner, which is especially helpful in the classroom.
* It is much more than I can explain in 20 minutes.

    2. Desktop application: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
* Public projects are *free*; private projects require a fee.
* Students and educators are eligible for *free* private projects at [https://education.github.com/](https://education.github.com/).

# GitHub’s Pros and Cons?

## (Some) Cons (for the Learner)

* Requires a new learning paradigm.
* Learning is more proactive.

^
* Careful attention is required, especially at the outset.
* Note-taking is different, because I write the notes for you.
* Adding GitHub to a learner’s workflow means there is more software to manage.

# GitHub’s Pros and Cons?

## (Some) Pros (for the Educator)
* Easy to disperse lectures to learners.
* Easy to distinguish lectures between classes.
* Easy to switch between learners on crit days.
* Easy to uncover plagiarism between learners.

^
* Slack a link to all my students in real time.
* Using tags, I can easily assign a repo to a course.
* Having everyone submit the same file in different branches makes it easy to distinguish one learner’s work from another.
* Git diffs make it easy to identify how similar two or more repos are, and which one came first.
